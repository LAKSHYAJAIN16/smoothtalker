More like you're nailing it till you're acing it. And hey, if you're a shield, I'm down to be your sword.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: sometimes i just feel like a walking meme, tryna keep up this extrovert fa\u00e7ade lol.\nHim: Walking meme?

Extrovert or not, you're trending in my world.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: lol, it's like everyone thinks I'm this life of the party, but inside I'm just memes and existential dread.\nHim: Memes and existential dread? Sounds like a perfect mix for our next Netflix and deep convo night.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: i'm just out here, putting on a show, but deep down, I'm more Netflix chill than wild thrill.\nHim: So, when's the premiere of our chill session? I'll bring the popcorn and you bring those 'fake' extrovert vibes.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: pretending to be all bubbly is exhausting, tbh. wish i could just vibe without the performance.\nHim: Let's drop the act and keep it 100. Our vibes could start a whole new wave, no performance needed. ", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
