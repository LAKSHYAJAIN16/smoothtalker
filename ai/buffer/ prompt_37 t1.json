Amy's out here leveling up while he's stuck in tutorial mode, lol.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Seriously though, was she just a post-breakup phase? I mean, he seemed into her, but not like 'forever' into her, y'know?\nHim: For real, he was playing checkers while she was playing 4D chess. Amy's queen material, and he's just a pawn, lmao.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: But like, do you think he ever really cared? Amy was legit, and he just ghosted.\nHim: Cared? More like scared. Amy's got that big brain energy, and he couldn't handle the vibe. Total cringe.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: I just can't with him. Amy was the best thing that happened to him, and he treated her like DLC.\nHim: Facts. She's main quest epic loot, and he lost the game before it even started. Smh.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Amy's all that and a bag of chips, and he was out here acting like she's a side quest.\nHim: Right? Dude missed the whole plot. Amy's the kind of rare drop you get once in a lifetime, and he was too busy respawning. ", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
