{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: tbh, I still can't get over the fact that Beth died. Like, it felt like I lost a part of me. \ud83d\ude2d\nHim: Oh, totally get it. Losing fictional characters hits differently. Can't believe Mr. Darcy never matched up to Beth's awesomeness, lmao. \ud83d\ude02\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: I swear, Beth's death scarred me for life! The pain was just too real, you know?\nHim: Haha, tell me about it. Plot twists like that make me question everything. But nothing beats the joy of skipping those regal novels, am I right? \ud83d\ude1c\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Ugh, Beth's death in that book felt like a punch to my heart. The struggle was too real, dude.\nHim: Totally feel you, but hey, if skipping those regal novels means avoiding heartbreak, count me in! Can't be dealing with all that drama, lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Seriously, I bawled my eyes out when Beth died. It was like losing a real friend, you know?\nHim: Haha, can't say I understand the pain of losing a fictional friend, but hey, at least we're not stuck in those Elizabethan novels. Who needs all that formality, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Dude, Beth's death hit me like a ton of bricks. I never thought I'd cry so much over a book character. \ud83d\ude2d\nHim: Haha, I feel you. But hey, at least we don't have to deal with all that fancy regal stuff. Pride and Prejudice was alright, but I'll take our sarcastic banter any day, lol. \ud83d\ude0e", "prompt": "\n                I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls. I need you to generate some conversations.\n\n    Here is the sample conversation-\n\n    Her : incredibly sagacious person. \n    Him : yes yes yes. totally.\n\n    An example of a valid answers for this convesation would be-\n\n    CONVERSATION\n    Her : im super wise wtf\n    Him : of course, Socrates ;)\n    ,\n    CONVERSATION\n    Her : im so smart\n    Him : does that mean that our children will be intelligent baby  ;)\n\n    I emphasis this again - the messages from 'her' and 'him' must have the same theme as the prompt. They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n    I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n    Here is your prompt. \n    Her : Her : no. jo > amy > beth > meg. beth was literally my child. i cried soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much when she died.  \n    Him : Him : honestly i just don't like elizabethan or whatever novels. the regal ones. too much pomp and circumstance. i mean pride and prejudice was alr. \n    \n    The 5 Conversations must have unique messages for her and him.
