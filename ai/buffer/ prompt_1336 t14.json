So why do I need a Percy when I've got all this brainpower? \ud83e\udde0\nHim: 'Cause even a wise goddess needs a hero sometimes... and I've got a sword.

But just so you know, I always win. \ud83d\ude1c\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Channeling my inner Annabeth, but honestly, I'm just here for the adventure... and maybe a cute Percy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nHim: Adventure's my middle name, and I've been told I'm cute... by my mom. Does that count? \ud83e\udd14\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: They say Annabeth is wise, but I just outsmarted Google. Top that, Percy. \ud83d\ude0c\nHim: Easy. I just outsmarted autocorrect.
