And let's not stress about tomorrow, living for the now is the vibe.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: So, I'm in the club of smartypants?\nHim: No doubt, you're the president. Future? Psh, that's so yesterday. We're doing things now.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Guess I'm too clever to pass up, huh?\nHim: Absolutely, Einstein's got nothing on you. Forget the future, we're making moves today.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: I better be getting my welcome kit.\nHim: It's in the mail, along with a 'No Overthinking' sign.
