{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: so it was my other sister's wedding, and the hotels were like, totally booked. We had to Airbnb the attic for the cousins, lol.\nHim: Airbnb the attic? Sounds like a reality show. How many seasons are we expecting?\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Seriously, every room was taken, so we got creative with the guest houses. It was like playing Tetris with people.\nHim: People Tetris, huh? Bet you're the kind of strategic mind we need for the zombie apocalypse.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: I swear, organizing where everyone stayed was more complex than the wedding itself. I'm like a low-key event planner now.\nHim: Low-key? More like MVP of logistics. Next up: planning the escape routes for when your family does karaoke.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: You wouldn't believe the drama. I had to bunk with my cousins and their five kids. Felt like a sleepover from hell.\nHim: Five kids? That's not a sleepover, that's a full-blown daycare. You charge by the hour or the tantrum?\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: And just when I thought I had it all sorted, my aunt decides she's allergic to the guest house's curtains. Like, how?\nHim: Allergic to curtains? That's... oddly specific. Maybe she's just a pioneer in the field of textile intolerance.
