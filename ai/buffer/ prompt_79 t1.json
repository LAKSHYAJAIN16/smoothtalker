{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: Pride and Prejudice is lowkey a deep dive into societal norms, not just a love story, ya know?\nHim: Facts. It's all about Darcy's glow-up from prideful to humble. Elizabeth's prejudice got a reality check too.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Bet you didn't catch the real tea in Pride and Prejudice. It's all about character development and society, not just romance.\nHim: True that. Darcy dropping his pride like it's hot and Lizzie checking her snap judgments at the door.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Everyone sleeps on the fact that Pride and Prejudice is more than a 'will they, won't they'. It's a whole societal critique.\nHim: No cap, it's about Darcy and Lizzy leveling up as people. That's the real ship.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Mr. Darcy's arc in Pride and Prejudice is a whole mood. It's not just about getting the girl.\nHim: Yeah, it's about him ditching the ego and Lizzie ditching the 'tude. They're both woke by the end.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Pride and Prejudice ain't just about the chase, it's about Darcy and Lizzy checking themselves before they wreck themselves.\nHim: Agreed. It's like a guide on how to not be cringe in Regency England. Darcy's pride got yeeted and Lizzy's prejudice got deleted.\n", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
