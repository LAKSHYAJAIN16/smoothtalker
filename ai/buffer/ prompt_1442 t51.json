They're missing the real question: How'd you get that high IQ and high key cuteness? \ud83e\udd13\u2764\ufe0f\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Lol, is this test for real? Asking about past crushes is peak dumbness. \ud83d\ude02\nHim: Facts. It's not ready for the saga of your secret admirers. \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udc96\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Ugh, this test is pure cap. \ud83e\udde2\nHim: No cap, it's 'cause it can't handle the truth of your genius. \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Bet this test was made by a bot, no offense. \ud83d\ude05\nHim: None taken.

They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n        I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n        Here is your prompt. \n        Her : Her : yesh. have i had a crush in the past?. why are questions on this test so stupid ?.  \n        Him : Him : \n\n        Your Conversations must be of the format :\n        CONVERSATION\n        Her : 'message'\n        Him : 'message'.\n\n        I want just the conversations.
