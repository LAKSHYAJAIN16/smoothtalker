Yeah, I think he loved the idea of Amy more than he actually loved her, if you know what I mean.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: I always wondered if Amy was just a rebound. What do you think?\nHim: Honestly, it's like he was playing a game of Relationship Checkers. Amy was just another piece he moved around to fill the void. So messed up.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Do you think he truly loved Amy, or was she just a rebound?\nHim: Let's be real, he treated Amy like she was on the clearance rack while he was busy window shopping for someone better. She deserved way more than him.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Amy totally deserved better than him, don't you think?\nHim: Absolutely! She deserved a guy who would put her on a pedestal, not leave her hanging like some second-hand coat. She's way too good for him.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Amy deserved someone who'd never treat her as a second choice.\nHim: No cap! Amy deserved someone who'd treat her like she's the only option in the entire buffet line.
