Kinda makes you think of a certain dictator's aesthetic, huh?\nHim: Totally, it's like Mother Nature took one look at history and said, 'Hold my beer.'\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Yo, the sky's turning red and it's lowkey making me think we're in a villain origin story.\nHim: Guess it's time to pick out our super-villain names. I'm leaning towards 'Captain Cringe.'\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Red skies? What is this, a color-coded alert for the next world war?\nHim: Seems like it. If we start seeing green skies, that's when we worry about alien invasions, lmao.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Skies in Bulgaria and Mongolia are on some real 'fire nation' stuff right now.\nHim: Right?
