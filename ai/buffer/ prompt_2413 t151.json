I need you to generate some conversations.\n\n        Here is the sample conversation-\n\n        Her : incredibly sagacious person. \n        Him : yes yes yes. totally.\n\n        An example of a valid answers for this convesation would be-\n\n        CONVERSATION 1\n        Her : im super wise wtf\n        Him : of course, Socrates ;)\n        ,\n\n        CONVERSATION 2\n        Her : im so smart\n        Him : does that mean that our children will be intelligent baby  ;)\n\n        I emphasis this again - the messages from 'her' and 'him' must have the same theme as the prompt.
