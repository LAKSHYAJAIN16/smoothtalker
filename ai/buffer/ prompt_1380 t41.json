In math, they're like the cheekbones of geometry. Sharp and defined.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Honestly, contouring is just drawing attention to the features you already got.\nHim: So, it's like a highlight reel for your face? Bet, you're the MVP every time.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: I'm not huge on contour, feels too much like a math problem.\nHim: But you solve it like a pro every time. No cap, your face is the solution.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Contour? More like con-touring the world with that art on your face.\nHim: And every time you walk in, it's like a world premiere. No cringe, all class.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Contour's okay, but I don't trust anything that makes me look like a geometry quiz.\nHim: Lol, guess I'm acing the test then, 'cause every angle of you is perfection.\n", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.

They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n        I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n        Here is your prompt. \n        Her : Her : 1... because idt you'd like contour that much. i like contour but its not my fav thing ever.  \n        Him : Him : contours are cool though. in math. \n\n        Your Conversations must be of the format :\n        CONVERSATION\n        Her : 'message'\n        Him : 'message'.\n\n        I want just the conversations. No filler messages or content which AI usually gives.\n\n        Thanks bro.\n        "}
