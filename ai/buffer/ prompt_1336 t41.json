Modern problems require ancient solutions, amirite?\nHim: Facts, but if you're Annabeth, guess I'm your Percy by default. Ready to take on a cyclops or two.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: So if I'm channeling Annabeth, does that make me a demigod of wisdom now? Lol.\nHim: Only if I can be your god-tier partner in crime. We'd be the ultimate power couple.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Honestly, pulling an Odysseus and calling myself 'Nobody' sounds like a vibe. Ghosting 101.\nHim: Lmao, then I'm 'Somebody' who's totally into 'Nobody'. Guess we're writing our own epic.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Since I'm on my Annabeth chase, where's my seaweed brain at?\nHim: Right here, but I'm more of a 'smart kelp' kinda guy. Upgrade, you know?\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: I'm out here strategizing like Annabeth, and you're...?\nHim: Playing the part of Percy, obviously.
