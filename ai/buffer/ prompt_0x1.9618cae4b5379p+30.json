Can we just stay on that island forever and be surrounded by adorable fluffballs? #PuppyParadise\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: and then I find a time machine and travel back to the 80s, rockin' big hair and neon outfits.\nHim: That's totally tubular! Can I join you in the time machine and bring some epic dance moves? Let's bring back the best of the 80s, like crimped hair and the Moonwalk!\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: and then I discover a magical potion that gives me the ability to speak every language fluently.\nHim: Damn, you're like the human version of Google Translate!
