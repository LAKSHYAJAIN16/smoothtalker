{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: sure. which one do you want?\nHim: 50/50. Split decision, like my chances of getting your number, lol.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: sure. which one do you want?\nHim: 50/50. Just like us, perfectly balanced, as all things should be.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: sure. which one do you want?\nHim: 50/50. Half for me, half for you, and a 100% chance of an epic fail. #cringe\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: sure. which one do you want?\nHim: 50/50. Kinda like my replies, half witty, half hoping you'll laugh.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: sure. which one do you want?\nHim: 50/50. Like my playlist, half is love songs, the other half is \"In case she says no\". ", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls. I need you to generate some conversations.\n\n        Here is the sample conversation-\n\n        Her : incredibly sagacious person. \n        Him : yes yes yes. totally.\n\n        An example of a valid answers for this convesation would be-\n\n        CONVERSATION 1\n        Her : im super wise wtf\n        Him : of course, Socrates ;)\n        ,\n\n        CONVERSATION 2\n        Her : im so smart\n        Him : does that mean that our children will be intelligent baby  ;)\n\n        I emphasis this again - the messages from 'her' and 'him' must have the same theme as the prompt. They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n        I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n        Here is your prompt. \n        Her : Her : sure. which one do you want ?.  \n        Him : Him : 50/50. \n\n        Your Conversations must be of the format :\n        CONVERSATION\n        Her : 'message'\n        Him : 'message'.\n\n        I want just the conversations. No filler messages or content which AI usually gives.\n\n        Thanks bro.\n        "}
