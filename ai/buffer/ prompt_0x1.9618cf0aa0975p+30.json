{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.\nHim: I know, right? They turned them into total clowns. It's like they took a masterclass in character assassination. \ud83e\udd21\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.\nHim: I feel you! It's like the writers got high on some lame potion and just threw logic out the window. It's cringe-worthy, tbh. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.\nHim: Totally! It's like they hired a bunch of monkeys instead of writers. I wouldn't be surprised if they just pulled character ideas out of a hat. \ud83d\ude48\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.\nHim: Ugh, tell me about it! It's like they let a toddler loose in the script room. I can't even. \ud83d\ude44\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.\nHim: I feel your pain, bro. It's as if they were playing a game of \"How many characters can we ruin in a single season?\" and they won by a landslide.

They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n    I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n    Here is your prompt. \n    Her : Her : but the fuck up they did with the characters?!?!?. no.  \n    Him : Him : the part with jo when she doesn't accept actual criticism. or the part with meg. \n    \n    The 5 Conversations must have unique messages for her and him. The prompt for 'her' must be different everytime.\n                "}
