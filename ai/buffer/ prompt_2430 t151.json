{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\nHer: i've been trying to convince myself that its nothing too huge and that i'm just acting like i'm a tragic character in a novel or sum.\nHim: Chill with the drama, Shakespeare. Life's not a novel, but if it was, you'd be the best-selling author for sure.\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Sometimes I feel like I'm just overplaying my part, ya know? Like, am I a main character or just extra dramatic?\nHim: Main character vibes only, no cap. You've got that protagonist energy that can't be scripted.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: I keep telling myself it's not a big deal, but deep down, I'm like, 'Am I in a soap opera?'\nHim: If you are, then it's the most binge-worthy show out there. Got me hooked on every episode, lol.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Do you ever think we're all just characters trying too hard to be deep in some cosmic story?\nHim: Yeah, but you're the one with the plot twists that keep everyone guessing. Total page-turner.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: I swear I'm not trying to be the tragic heroine, but sometimes it feels like it, lmao.\nHim: Tragic? Nah, you're the hero in this narrative. And trust me, it's anything but a tragedy when you're in the scene. ", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
