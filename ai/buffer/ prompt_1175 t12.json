You've got the thunder, just bring the lightning! \u26a1\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: Twins and Hermes, huh? More like needing a divine intervention to get this off the ground.\nHim: No cap, you're the Athena of project planning. Strategize and conquer, goddess!\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: Bet, focusing on the twins and Hermes is cool and all, but executing is a whole other odyssey.\nHim: Lol, just don't pull an Icarus and fly too close to the sun. Keep it Ithaca-level chill and you'll slay.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: Twins and Hermes? Sounds like we're crafting a myth, not a project. Kinda cringe tbh.\nHim: Nah, it's epic. You're gonna make this project a legend \u2013 just dodge those Sirens of doubt.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: So we're vibing with the twins and Hermes? Idk, feels like I'm in a labyrinth with this idea.\nHim: Just grab that Minotaur by the horns! You've got the wit of Hermes \u2013 finesse your way through. \ud83d\ude09", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.

Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n        I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n        Here is your prompt. \n        Her : Her : ohhhh. alr. so focus on the twins and hermes. got that. idk about this idea tbh..i think it was good conceptually. but now that i have to execute it.  \n        Him : Him : i get it. maybe try refining the idea a bit more?. \n\n        Your Conversations must be of the format :\n        CONVERSATION\n        Her : 'message'\n        Him : 'message'.\n\n        I want just the conversations.
