Maybe we should all start downloading a \"boyfriend simulator\" app instead.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: you know what's sad? My book husbands are more invested in our relationship than any real dude.\nHim: Well, at least they won't ghost you or leave you on \"read.\" #bookbaesforthegoals\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: I'm starting to think book bfs are the only loyal ones out there. Real guys are just playing games.\nHim: Right? Maybe we should start a petition for mandatory loyalty lessons in schools or something.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: my book crushes are so dreamy, it hurts. It's like they're right in front of me but can't touch them.\nHim: Yeah, it's like they're trapped within the pages, mocking us with their perfect fictional existence. #bookcrushstruggles", "prompt": "\n                I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.

They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n    I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n    Here is your prompt. \n    Her : Her : yk far too much about my book husbands and wives. and book bfs.  \n    Him : Him : oh yes you have zero book crushes. \n    \n    The 5 Conversations must have unique messages for her and him.
