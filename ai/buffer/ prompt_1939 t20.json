Or should I say... your type of series? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nCONVERSATION 2\nHer: yeah? i tried. but i couldn't get into it.\nHim: No worries, we'll find our show. Maybe one that's less 'salvation' and more 'chillaxation'. \ud83d\ude02\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: yeah? i tried. but i couldn't get into it.\nHim: That's cool, we can always switch to 'Survivor'. You'd outwit, outplay, outlast any show. \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: yeah? i tried. but i couldn't get into it.\nHim: Too highbrow? Let's dial it back with some reality TV. Nothing says romance like competitive baking. \ud83c\udf70\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: yeah? i tried. but i couldn't get into it.\nHim: No biggie. We'll start our own genre.
