They might as well replace female characters with actual eye candy, like lollipops or gummy bears. At least they taste better than boiled cabbage!\n\nCONVERSATION 2:\nHer: ugh i hate when that happens...it's like...authors ( don't kill me but this is mostly guys) just make the female characters eye candy who are like there for the visual and sexual pleasure of the male characters and have the personality of a boiled cabbbage and its annoying.\nHim: It's a sad reality, but let's be real, boiled cabbage has more flavor than some of those female characters. At least cabbage can add some spice to a dish!\n\nCONVERSATION 3:\nHer: ugh i hate when that happens...it's like...authors ( don't kill me but this is mostly guys) just make the female characters eye candy who are like there for the visual and sexual pleasure of the male characters and have the personality of a boiled cabbbage and its annoying.\nHim: I feel you!

Authors need to put more effort into creating female characters who are spicier than a chili pepper. We want well-rounded personalities, not boiled cabbage-like caricatures. Let's bring some heat to these stories!\n\nCONVERSATION 5:\nHer: ugh i hate when that happens...it's like...authors ( don't kill me but this is mostly guys) just make the female characters eye candy who are like there for the visual and sexual pleasure of the male characters and have the personality of a boiled cabbbage and its annoying.\nHim: Totally get your frustration! It's like they're serving us a plain rice cake when we deserve a delicious slice of pizza. Give us female characters with substance and cheesiness, not something as bland as boiled cabbage.
