Bet you've never met a girl who can quote memes all day.\nHim: it's just weird... usually, I'm the one dropping the dank references.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: with me? Hope you're ready for this jelly.\nHim: it's just weird, 'cause I'm not sure any container can hold all that flavor.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: with me? You sure you can keep up?\nHim: it's just weird, 'cause I thought I'd need a map to navigate your coolness.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: with me? Watch out, I might just out-cringe you.\nHim: it's just weird, 'cause I never thought I'd find 'cringe' so attractive.\n", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls. I need you to generate some conversations.\n\n        Here is the sample conversation-\n\n        Her : incredibly sagacious person. \n        Him : yes yes yes. totally.\n\n        An example of a valid answers for this convesation would be-\n\n        CONVERSATION 1\n        Her : im super wise wtf\n        Him : of course, Socrates ;)\n        ,\n\n        CONVERSATION 2\n        Her : im so smart\n        Him : does that mean that our children will be intelligent baby  ;)\n\n        I emphasis this again - the messages from 'her' and 'him' must have the same theme as the prompt. They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n        I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n        Here is your prompt. \n        Her : Her : with me?.  \n        Him : Him : it's just weird. and i don't really know what to do about it anymore. \n\n        Your Conversations must be of the format :\n        CONVERSATION\n        Her : 'message'\n        Him : 'message'.\n\n        I want just the conversations. No filler messages or content which AI usually gives.\n\n        Thanks bro.\n        "}
