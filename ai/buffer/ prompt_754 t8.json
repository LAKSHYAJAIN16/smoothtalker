Never heard of that temple lol.\nHim: Yeah, it's the size of my love for you \u2013 massive and kinda unexpected.\n\nCONVERSATION 3\nHer: No way, that's wild. I'm shook.\nHim: Bet, it's almost as surprising as me getting an A in math.\n\nCONVERSATION 4\nHer: That's crazy, I gotta see it to believe it.\nHim: It's like seeing me without a cap \u2013 rare but worth it.\n\nCONVERSATION 5\nHer: Seriously? That's so random.\nHim: Just like our convo, but hey, it's interesting, ain't it? \ud83d\ude09", "prompt": "\n                    I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
