Dressing up is fun.\nHim: I don't have the energy in me for another philosophical why-asking session.\nHer: Totally get it. Sometimes I wonder if dressing up is just society's way of saying \"Hey, can you please look more attractive than you already are?\" Not that I need it, obviously *hair flip*\nHim: Yeah, it's like they expect us to be fashion models 24/7.
