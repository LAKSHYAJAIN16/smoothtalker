{"message": "CONVERSATION 1\n\nHer: men have always tried to control women's lives.\nHim: yeah, just as much as I try to control my Netflix queue. Good luck with that. \ud83d\ude02\n\nCONVERSATION 2\n\nHer: society has conditioned women to conform to unrealistic beauty standards.\nHim: oh yeah, just like how society has conditioned me to think I can fix everything by hitting it. So unrealistic. \ud83d\ude44\n\nCONVERSATION 3\n\nHer: women are constantly judged based on their appearance.\nHim: totally, just like how I'm constantly judged based on my choice of gaming console. Looks like we both cannot catch a break. \ud83d\ude05\n\nCONVERSATION 4\n\nHer: women have had to fight twice as hard to prove themselves in male-dominated fields.\nHim: damn, sounds like the struggle I have to face when trying to wake up on Monday mornings. We're both out here breaking barriers. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCONVERSATION 5\n\nHer: women are belittled and told to \"stay in their place\".\nHim: ugh, that's like when my phone battery hits 1% and tells me I'm not allowed to use it anymore. We all deserve better. \ud83d\ude24", "prompt": "\n                I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.

They must be funny, witty and charming. They must be sexy and attractive. The conversations must be in Gen Z slang. lmao, lol, cringe and cap would be appreciated. Make them as sarcastic as possible.\n\n    I need 5 conversations like this, with unique messages for her and him.\n\n    Here is your prompt. \n    Her : Her : women were used as pawns to get richer.  \n    Him : Him : and the bible was written in the.... 0th century. and written according to its times. \n    \n    The 5 Conversations must have unique messages for her and him. The prompt for 'her' must be different everytime.\n                "}
