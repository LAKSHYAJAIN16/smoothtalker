He was so thirsty to be a part of the march family jeez. I mean, I get it, Amy had a little crush on him, but it wasn't like she planned to marry him. He was just using her as a backup plan since Jo was off-limits. And here I was, crushing on this total beige flag. What was I thinking?\nHim: Hold up, did you just say you crushed on Laurie too?\n\nCONVERSATION 4:\nHer: omg laurie was such a try-hard to join the march family. like Amy's crush on him was cute but not endgame material. he was legit treating her like a plan B, all because he couldn't have Jo. and can we take a moment to acknowledge my poor taste in guys? crushing on a complete beige flag, smh.\nHim: Wait, you had a crush on Laurie? Seriously?\n\nCONVERSATION 5:\nHer: Laurie, really? He was so desperate to be part of the March family it's cringe-worthy. Amy's crush was innocent, not some master plan. But he played her, treating her like a backup just because he couldn't have Jo. And to think, I used to have feelings for this basic beige flag. Ugh, teenagers, right?\nHim: Hold on a sec, did you say you once crushed on Laurie too? Seriously?", "prompt": "\n                I'm creating an AI bot designed to help teenage guys talk to girls.
